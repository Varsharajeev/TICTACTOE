This is my first project(TicTacToe) a game developed using java swing  GUI.A player in the game of tic tac toe wins if they line up three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. Start off with rows. To iterate through each row we may use a for loop.The key features of the game are:
1)It has a reset button
2)It is made interactive
